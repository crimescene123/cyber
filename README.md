## Purpose
The purpose of this encryption and decryption script is to simulate a ransomware attack scenario for educational and demonstration purposes. In this scenario, a threat actor (the attacker) encrypts a file on the victim's system, rendering the file inaccessible without decryption. The victim is then required to pay a ransom to receive the decryption key necessary to unlock and access their files.
### File Encryption (encrypt.ps1):
The script demonstrates how ransomware encrypts a file using a strong encryption algorithm (AES in this case) to lock the file and prevent unauthorized access.
### File Decryption (decrypt.ps):
he decryption script shows how the encrypted file can be restored to its original state once the correct decryption key is provided. This highlights the critical role of the decryption key in recovering encrypted files.
